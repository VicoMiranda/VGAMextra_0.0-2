# VGAMextra_0.0-2
VGAMextra-V0.0-2_Pre-release

This is an interim distribution of the 'VGAMextra' package.
It fixes bugs and other coding issues that are found before 
submitting the next official version to CRAN.

Tested okay for VGAM 1.1-0, which is the required version by
VGAMextra (Linux machines). For further details on VGAM and
its distribution see:

NOTE: For Windows machines (.zip file), VGAMextra_0.0-2 has been
tested okay for VGAM version 1.0-7 ! But will be updated soon.
